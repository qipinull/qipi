            <p class="tc">This is my biggest project, its a small game in pygame based around getting new high scores.<br \>
            There are enimies falling from the top of the screen, falling at random speeds while the player <br \>has to
            dodge them and collect points. If the player hits an enemy they loose a point,
            There are <br \>multiple game modes, timed and infinite. Timed has a 60 second limit where the goal is
            to get <br \>a high score which is saved in a seperate document, the same is said for the infinite game <br \>mode
            where the timer keeps counting up indefinitly.</p>

            <p class="tc">This is the game from Project 3, now called Droplets. I'm now making it in an actual game engine, <a href="https://gamemaker.io/en" target="_blank">Game Maker</a>.<br>
                There is a working menu, game, and end screen finished. As I continue this project, I would like to eventually publish it.<br>
                on a site such as <a href="https://itch.io" target="_blank">Itch.io</a>. I have implemented a bonus meter and a slow meter. The latter is self-explanatory,<br>
                whereas the bonus meter increases as you gain score without getting hit, giving bonuses.</p>
